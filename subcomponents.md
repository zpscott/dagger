Subcomponents are components that inherit and extend the object graph of a
parent component. You can use them to partition your application's object graph
into subgraphs either to encapsulate different parts of your application from
each other or to use more than one scope within a component.

An object bound in a subcomponent can depend on any object that is bound in its
parent component or any ancestor component, in addition to objects that are
bound in its own modules. On the other hand, objects bound in parent components
can't depend on those bound in subcomponents; nor can objects bound in one
subcomponent depend on objects bound in sibling subcomponents.

In other words, the object graph of a subcomponent's parent component is a
subgraph of the object graph of the subcomponent itself.


## Declaring a subcomponent

Just like for top-level components, you create a subcomponent by writing an
abstract class or interface that declares [abstract methods that return the
types your application cares about][component-methods]. Instead of annotating a
subcomponent with [`@Component`], you annotate it with [`@Subcomponent`] and
install [`@Module`]s.

```java
@Subcomponent(modules = RequestModule.class)
inferface RequestComponent {
  RequestHandler requestHandler();
}
```

## Adding a subcomponent to a parent component

To add a subcomponent to a parent component, add an [abstract factory
method][component-subcomponents] to the parent component that returns the
subcomponent. If the subcomponent requires a module that does not have a no-arg
public constructor, and that module is not installed into the parent component,
then the factory method must have a parameter of that module's type.  The
factory method may have other parameters for any other modules that are
installed on the subcomponent but not on the parent component. (The subcomponent
will automatically share the instance of any module shared between it and its
parent.)

```java
@Component(modules = {ServerModule.class, AuthModule.class})
interface ServerComponent {
  Server server();
  SessionComponent sessionComponent(SessionModule sessionModule);
}

@Subcomponent(modules = SessionModule.class)
interface SessionComponent {
  SessionInfo sessionInfo();
  RequestComponent requestComponent();
}

@Subcomponent(modules = {RequestModule.class, AuthModule.class})
interface RequestComponent {
  RequestHandler requestHandler();
}
```

Bindings from `SessionComponent`'s modules can depend on bindings from
`ServerComponent`'s modules, and bindings from `RequestComponent`'s modules can
depend on bindings from both `SessionComponent`'s and `ServerComponent`'s
modules.

In order to create an instance of a subcomponent, you call the factory method on
an instance of its parent component.

```java
ServerComponent serverComponent = DaggerServerComponent.create();
SessionComponent sessionComponent =
    serverComponent.sessionComponent(new SessionModule(…));
RequestComponent requestComponent = sessionComponent.requestComponent();
```

Often you need to create subcomponents from within an object bound inside a
parent component. To do that, you can rely on the fact that any binding in a
component can depend on the component type itself.

```java
class BoundInServerComponent {
  @Inject ServerComponent serverComponent;

  void doSomethingWithSessionInfo() {
    SessionComponent sessionComponent =
        serverComponent.sessionComponent(new SessionModule(…));
    sessionComponent.sessionInfo().doSomething();
  }
}
```

### Subcomponent builders

You can also define a builder for your subcomponent, similarly to how
[component builders] are defined.

```java
@Component(modules = {ServerModule.class, AuthModule.class})
interface ServerComponent {
  Server server();
  SessionComponent.Builder sessionComponentBuilder();
}

@Subcomponent(modules = SessionModule.class)
interface SessionComponent {
  @Subcomponent.Builder
  interface Builder {
    Builder sessionModule(SessionModule sessionModule);
    SessionComponent build();
  }
}

ServerComponent serverComponent = DaggerServerComponent.create();
SessionComponent sessionComponent = serverComponent.sessionComponentBuilder()
    .sessionModule(new SessionModule(…))
    .build();
```

#### Injecting subcomponent builders

Like the component itself, subcomponent builders are bound in the graph and can
be injected, too. So instead of injecting the component and calling the subcomponent
builder method on it, you can inject the builder itself:

```java
  /** Injecting the subcomponent builder. This is simpler than what's below. */
  class SessionStarterInjectingSubcomponentBuilder {
    private final SessionComponent.Builder sessionComponentBuilder;
    
    @Inject SessionStarterInjectingSubcomponentBuilder(
        SessionComponent.Builder sessionComponentBuilder) {
      this.sessionComponentBuilder = sessionComponentBuilder;
    }
    
    Session startSession() {
      return sessionComponentBuilder
          .sessionModule(new SessionModule(…))
          .build()
          .session();
    }
  }

  /**
   * Injecting the component and calling the factory method. Not as simple as
   * what's above.
   */
  class SessionStarterInjectingComponent {
    private final ServerComponent serverComponent;
    
    @Inject SessionStarterInjectingComponent(ServerComponent serverComponent) {
      this.serverComponent = serverComponent;
    }

    Session startSession() {
      return serverComponent.sessionComponentBuilder()
          .sessionModule(new SessionModule(…))
          .build()
          .session();
    }
  }
```

Note that `SessionStarterInjectingSubcomponentBuilder` doesn't refer to
`ServerComponent` at all.

## Subcomponents and scope

<!-- TODO(dpb,gak): Describe scopes independently from subcomponents. -->

One reason to break your application's component up into subcomponents is to use
[scopes][`@Scope`]. With normal, unscoped bindings, each user of an injected
type may get a new, separate instance. But if the binding is scoped, then all
users of that binding *within the scope's lifetime* get the same instance of the
bound type.

The standard scope is [`@Singleton`]. Users of singleton-scoped bindings all
get the same instance.

In Dagger, a component can be associated with a scope by annotating it with a
[`@Scope`] annotation. In that case, the component implementation holds
references to all scoped objects so they can be reused. Modules with
[`@Provides`] methods annotated with a scope may only be installed into a
component annotated with the same scope.

(Types with [`@Inject`] constructors may also be annotated with scope
annotations. These "implicit bindings" may be used by any component annotated
with that scope *or any of its descendant components.* The scoped instance will
be bound in the correct scope.)

No subcomponent may be associated with the same scope as any ancestor component,
although two subcomponents that are not mutually reachable can be associated
with the same scope because there is no ambiguity about where to store the
scoped objects. (The two subcomponents effectively have different scope
*instances* even if they use the same scope annotation.)

For example, in the component tree below, `BadChildComponent` has the same
`@RootScope` annotation as its parent, `RootComponent`, and that is an error.
But `SiblingComponentOne` and `SiblingComponentTwo` can both use `@ChildScope`
because there is no way to confuse a binding in one with a binding of the same
type in another.

```java
@RootScope @Component
interface RootComponent {
  BadChildComponent badChildComponent(); // ERROR!
  SiblingComponentOne siblingComponentOne();
  SiblingComponentTwo siblingComponentTwo();
}

@RootScope @Subcomponent
interface BadChildComponent {…}

@ChildScope @Subcomponent
interface SiblingComponentOne {…}

@ChildScope @Subcomponent
interface SiblingComponentTwo {…}
```

Because a subcomponent is instantiated by calling a method on its parent, its
lifetime is strictly smaller than its parent's. That means that it makes sense
to associate smaller scopes with subcomponents and larger scope with parent
components. In fact, you almost always want the root component to use the
[`@Singleton`] scope.

In the example below, `RootComponent` is in [`@Singleton`] scope.
`@SessionScope` is nested within [`@Singleton`] scope, and `@RequestScope` is
nested within `@SessionScope`. Note that `FooRequestComponent` and
`BarRequestComponent` are both associated with `@RequestScope`, which works
because they are siblings; neither is an ancestor of the other.

```java
@Singleton @Component
interface RootComponent {
  SessionComponent sessionComponent();
}

@SessionScope @Subcomponent
interface SessionComponent {
  FooRequestComponent fooRequestComponent();
  BarRequestComponent barRequestComponent();
}

@RequestScope @Subcomponent
interface FooRequestComponent {…}

@RequestScope @Subcomponent
interface BarRequestComponent {…}
```

## Subcomponents for encapsulation

Another reason to use subcomponents is to encapsulate different parts of your
application from each other. For example, if two services in your server (or
two screens in your application) share some bindings, say those used for
authentication and authorization, but each have other bindings that really have
nothing to do with each other, it might make sense to create separate
subcomponents for each service or screen, and to put the shared bindings into
the parent component. In the example above, `FooRequestComponent` and
`BarRequestComponent` are separate, sibling components. You could combine them
into one `@RequestScope` component with all their modules, but you might have
some conflicting bindings.

### Extending multibindings

Like other bindings, [multibindings](multibindings.md) in a parent component are
visible to bindings in subcomponents. But subcomponents can also add
multibindings to maps and sets bound in their parent. Any such additional
contributions are visible only to bindings within the subcomponent or its
subcomponents, and are not visible within the parent.

```java
@Component(modules = ParentModule.class)
interface Parent {
  Map<String, Int> map();
  Set<String> set();

  Child child();
}

@Module
class ParentModule {
  @Provides @IntoMap
  @StringKey("one") static int one() {
    return 1;
  }

  @Provides @IntoMap
  @StringKey("two") static int two() {
    return 2;
  }

  @Provides @IntoSet
  static String a() {
    return "a"
  }

  @Provides @IntoSet
  static String b() {
    return "b"
  }
}

@Subcomponent(modules = Child.class)
interface Child {
  Map<String, String> map();
  Set<String> set();
}

@Module
class ChildModule {
  @Provides @IntoMap
  @StringKey("three") static int three() {
    return 3;
  }

  @Provides @IntoMap
  @StringKey("four") static int four() {
    return 4;
  }

  @Provides @IntoSet
  static String c() {
    return "c"
  }

  @Provides @IntoSet
  static String d() {
    return "d"
  }
}

Parent parent = DaggerParent.create();
Child child = parent.child();
assertThat(parent.map().keySet()).containsExactly("one", "two");
assertThat(child.map().keySet()).containsExactly("one", "two", "three", "four");
assertThat(parent.set()).containsExactly("a", "b");
assertThat(child.set()).containsExactly("a", "b", "c", "d");
```

### Repeated modules

When the same module type is installed in a component and any of its
subcomponents, then each of those components will automatically use the same
instance of the module. This means that it is an error if a subcomponent factory
method includes a repeated module as a parameter or if you call a subcomponent
builder method for a repeated module. (The latter cannot be checked at compile
time, and is a runtime error.)

```java
@Component(modules = {RepeatedModule.class, …})
interface ComponentOne {
  ComponentTwo componentTwo(RepeatedModule repeatedModule); // COMPILE ERROR!
  ComponentThree.Builder componentThreeBuilder();
}

@Subcomponent(modules = {RepeatedModule.class, …})
interface ComponentTwo { … }

@Subcomponent(modules = {RepeatedModule.class, …})
interface ComponentThree {
  @Subcomponent.Builder
  interface Builder {
    Builder repeatedModule(RepeatedModule repeatedModule);
    ComponentThree build();
  }
}

DaggerComponentOne.create().componentThreeBuilder()
    .repeatedModule(new RepeatedModule()) // UnsupportedOperationException!
    .build();
```
