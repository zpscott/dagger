Dagger is a fully static, compile-time [dependency injection][DI] framework for
both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version
[created](https://github.com/square/dagger) by
[Square] and now maintained by Google.

Dagger aims to address many of the development and performance issues that have
plagued reflection-based solutions. More details can be found in
[this talk][dagger-talk-video]([slides][dagger-talk-slides]) by
[+Gregory Kick].
